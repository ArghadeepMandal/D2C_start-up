# D2C_start-up
The task involves using machine learning techniques to analyze user activities, past purchases, and other features to predict whether a lead is likely to make a purchase in the next 3 months.
Here's a breakdown of the key sections in the repository based on the provided content:
## Objective:
The primary goal is to identify potential leads for a D2C startup by predicting their likelihood to buy a product.
## Data Dictionary:
Describes the fields in the training, testing, and submission datasets, including unique identifiers, dates, campaign information, past products purchased, user activities, and the target variable (buy).
## Table of Content:
Outlines the structure of the project with different steps.
## Steps:
Step 1: Importing Relevant Libraries
Step 2: Data Inspection
Step 3: Data Cleaning
